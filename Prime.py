print("Fill in the blanks for a fun story!")

name = input("Name?")
clo1 = input("Clothing?")
clo2 = input("Clothing?")
animal = input("Animal?")

print(f"{name} is so freaking cute! I like that little {clo1} they had on the other day. I need one so I can stop wearing my {clo2} out because it looks a hot ass mess. Like a damn {animal}" )
